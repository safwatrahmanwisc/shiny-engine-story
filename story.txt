There is a guy in Madison. He is a computer science major. He is a smart.

	His name is Safwat. He lives in Brazil. His dad works for the
government but not in Brazil. Is this a mystery? Find out further in the 
story when someone else finishes this. 

Hi, I'm here to help finish this story, but we're not here to talk about that
we're here to talk about Safwat's dad. Who is he? Only Bangladesh truly knows,
but we may have gained groundbreaking insight into this man of mystery.
Our inside sources have witnessed Safwat's dad entering and exiting numerous
Chic-Fil-A's without gaining a single pound. How is this possible if he is
truly eating there? The only logical explination is that he is an international 
spy using the widespread availability of the Chic-Fil-A franchise as a set of
dead drop zones. #StayWoke
